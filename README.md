### ðŸ“‚ Basics

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: [Simple Wire](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire)
**Statement:**  
*Create a module with one input and one output that behaves exactly like a wire. The output should always follow the input.*  

Unlike physical wires, wires (and other signals) in Verilog are **directional**.  
This means information flows in only one direction â€” from a source (also called a driver) to the sinks.  

In a Verilog "continuous assignment" (`assign out = in;`), the value of the signal on the left side is driven onto the wire on the right side.  
The assignment is *continuous* because it remains valid at all times, even if the input changes â€” not just a one-time event.

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: [Four Wires](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire4)
**Statement:**  
*Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires. The connections should be:*  
- `a -> w`  
- `b -> x`  
- `b -> y`  
- `c -> z`  
<img width="815" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93c50f51-d948-48a6-a71b-f556f809be1d" />

In Verilog, outputs can be directly assigned from inputs using **continuous assignments** (`assign`).  
Here, multiple outputs can be driven by the same input (for example, both `x` and `y` take the value of `b`).

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 3: [Inverter](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Notgate)
**Statement:**  
*Create a module that implements a NOT gate.*  
<img width="575" height="281" alt="Notgate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3911201-a3eb-4536-8de5-19dafc427b5c" />
The NOT gate (or inverter) outputs the logical complement of its input:  
- If the input is `1`, the output is `0`.  
- If the input is `0`, the output is `1`.  

In Verilog, this can be written using the **bitwise NOT operator (`~`)** inside a continuous assignment.

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 4: [AND Gate](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Andgate)
**Statement:**  
*Create a module with two inputs and one output that implements an AND gate.*  
<img width="586" height="281" alt="Andgate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f2bff74-1383-40a1-838f-d07abad2c8b3" />

The AND gate outputs `1` only when **both inputs are 1**.  
Otherwise, the output is `0`.  

In Verilog, this can be written using the **bitwise AND operator (`&`)** inside a continuous assignment.

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 5: NOR Gate[https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Norgate]
**Statement:**  
*Create a module with two inputs and one output that implements a NOR gate.*  
<img width="586" height="281" alt="Norgate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea3189ad-e731-4085-aa21-531c7683309d" />

The NOR gate is the **inversion of the OR gate**:  
- If **both inputs are 0**, the output is `1`.  
- Otherwise, the output is `0`.  

In Verilog, this can be written using the **bitwise OR operator (`|`)** followed by a bitwise NOT (`~`).

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 6: [XNOR Gate](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Xnorgate)
**Statement:**  
*Create a module with two inputs and one output that implements an XNOR gate.*  
<img width="586" height="281" alt="Xnorgate" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c822484a-5125-473d-9105-930c0a659528" />

The XNOR gate is the **complement of XOR**:  
- Output is `1` when both inputs are the same (00 or 11).  
- Output is `0` when inputs differ (01 or 10).  

In Verilog, this can be written using the **bitwise XOR operator (`^`)** followed by a NOT (`~`).

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 7: [Declaring Wires](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Wire_decl)
**Statement:**  
*Implement the following circuit*  
<img width="620" height="264" alt="Wiredecl2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49c9aa13-e362-40f1-bf78-745e965530fa" />

ðŸ‘‰ [View Solution](https://github.com/vindyav/verilog-practice-hdlbits/blob/main/basics/declaring_wires.v)

This demonstrates how to **declare internal wires** and connect them via **continuous assignments**.

#### ðŸ”¹ Problem 8: [7458 Chip](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/7458)
**Statement:**  
*The 7458 chip contains four AND gates and two OR gates. Create a module with the same functionality. It has 10 inputs and 2 outputs.*  
<img width="723" height="428" alt="7458" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6565037f-a815-4742-bb91-22bc059b1603" />

You can implement this in two ways:  
1. Using `assign` statements directly.  
2. Declaring intermediate wires for the outputs of the AND gates, then ORâ€™ing them together.

## ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: [Vector0](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Vector0)

Vectors are used to group related signals under one name.  
For example:  
`wire [7:0] w;`
This declares an 8-bit vector w, which is equivalent to declaring 8 separate wires.

Statement:
Build the following circuit:

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: [Vector1](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Vector1)

Vectors must be declared: `type [upper:lower] vector_name;`  
`type` specifies the datatype of the vector, usually wire or reg.  
This declares an 8-bit vector w, which is equivalent to declaring 8 separate wires.  

If you are declaring a input or output port, the type can additionally include the port type (e.g., input or output) as well. Some examples:  


`wire [7:0] w;`         // 8-bit wire  
`reg  [4:1] x;`        // 4-bit reg  
`output reg [0:0] y;`  // 1-bit reg that is also an output port (this is still a vector)  
`input wire [3:-2] z;`  // 6-bit wire input (negative ranges are allowed)  
`output [3:0] a;`       // 4-bit output wire. Type is 'wire' unless specified otherwise.  
`wire [0:7] b;`         // 8-bit wire where b[0] is the most-significant bit.  

Statement:  
Build a combinational circuit that splits an input half-word (16 bits, [15:0] ) into lower [7:0] and upper [15:8] bytes.
